# Youtube_video_Downloader
This repo contains a python app that downloads youtube videos given the url in the highest resolution.

#### IMPORTANT!

The first time you will run the program you have to configure the download path. If you dont, the default is the directory of the app. After the first setup you
dont have to set it up again only in case you want to change it.

### Known Issues

Sometimes in the first configuration of the download path, the app may not use the path correctly and download in the same directory of the python script. In this case you can kill and run again the script and it should work as expected.


### External modules
-tkinter

-pytube

-customtkinter

In case you dont have them you have to download them using : 

pip install "module name" or pip3 install "module name" 

depending of the python version you using.
